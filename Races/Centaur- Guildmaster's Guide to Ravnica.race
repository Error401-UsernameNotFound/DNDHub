    "Description": "In the sprawling city of Ravnica, where open road seems like a contradiction and open plain is sheer nonsense, centaurs nevertheless retain a love of wide spaces and the freedom to travel. As much as they can, centaurs run-in wide plazas, spacious parks, and expanses of rubble and ruin. They race the wind, hooves thundering and tails streaming behind them, until the next wall looms in their path and brings them to a stopCentaurs have the upper bodies, down to the waist, of muscular humans, displaying all the human variety of skin tones and features. Their ears are slightly pointed, but their faces are wider and squarer than those of elves. Below the waist, they have the bodies of small horses, with a similar range of coloration - from various s hades of chestnut or bay to dappled or even zebra like striped patterns. Most centaurs style their hair and their tails in a similar way. Selesnya centaurs favor long, flowing hair. Gruul centaurs cut their hair in rough. spiky styles.The upper bodies of centaurs are comparable to human torsos in size, and their lower equine bodies average about 4 feet tall al the withers. Though they are smaller than a human rider mounted on a horse, they fill similar roles as cavalry warriors. messengers, outriders, and scouts.",
