    "Name": "Harengon- The Wild Beyond the Witchlight",
    "Description": "Harengons originated in the Feywild, where they spoke Sylvan and embodied the spirit of freedom and travel. In time, these rabbitfolk hopped into other worlds, bringing the fey realm's exuberance with them and learning new languages as they went.Harengons are bipedal, with the characteristic long feet of the rabbits they resemble and fur in a variety of colors.

Harengons are blessed with a little fey luck, and they often find themselves a few fortunate feet away from dangers during adventures.",
