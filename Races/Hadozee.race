    "Description": "ce: Spelljammer: Adventures in Space - Astral Adventurer's GuideHadozees\u2019 progenitors were mammals no bigger than housecats. Hunted by larger natural predators, they took to the trees and evolved wing-like flaps that enabled them to glide from branch to branch.Today, hadozees are sapient, bipedal beings eager to leave behind the fearsome predators of their homeworld and explore other worldsIn addition to being natural climbers, hadozees have feet that are as dexterous as their hands, even to the extent of having opposable thumbs. Membranes of skin hang loosely from their arms and legs. When stretched taut, these membranes enable hadozees to glide. Hadozees wrap these wings around themselves to keep warm",
